Maze Generator and Solver

I wrote a maze generator that works with two commonly known algorithms: Depth First Search and Randomized Prims. Both of them generates mazes with a unique solution. Also, there is an implementation of the A Star algorithm to solve the mazes. Maze representation is made by making use of Undirected Graphs.

Credits to gengyu89 who implemented a maze generator and document it very well, it was the foundation to create my own. The Abstract Data Types used in my version are similar, but I made use of Dataclasses and dispense with some functions. I wrote some new implementations, added some new features and wrote other way to render content.

The graphic style was inspired on 80’s and 90’s retro art style found in this website: https://www.aesdes.org/2020/01/22/aesthetic-design-80s-and-90s-retro-art-style/.

The font used is ‘gomarice_no_continue.ttf` and it`s from the site https://www.1001fonts.com/.
